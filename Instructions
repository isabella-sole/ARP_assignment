Instructions to running the assignment.
Once inside the FinalAssignment_Bisio folder, open two terminals.
On the first one, enter the following lines:
$ make
$ ./Launcher

On the second one, enter:
$ killall -SIGUSR1 S 

The first terminal will create executables and then the Launcher file will open correctly the files.
The second terminal will start to send tokens.
